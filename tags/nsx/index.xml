      <title>NSX ALB (Advanced Load Balancer) Design</title>

      <description>I wrote three (3) blogs on Avi Load Balancing, now rebranded as VMware NSX ALB (Advanced Load Balancer). These were around the basic concepts, base configuration, and that configuration using API.

In this post, I want to discuss the design decisions when deploying an ALB solution and expand on my previous blogs.</description>

      <title>NSX-T Automation using Terraform</title>

      <description>I started the series with a post about why I wanted to use Terraform. Now we have the why out of the way, let’s get to the fun stuff… the how!
I use Terraform for 2 things. The first is to spin up SDDC’s on VMC and configure the VMC NSX-T piece. The second is spinning up NSX-T environments in the lab, which will hopefully make it into production one day.</description>

      <description>Hi all, I hope you are all doing well during these trying times.
For months, possibly even years, I’ve been convincing myself I’d dive into automation. What better time than one where I am forced into isolation with my laptop. In truth, I was jolted into action by a business requirement for automating the build of a number of environments. These environments had to be standardised and utilise many of the same configuration elements.</description>

      <description>API ReferenceI wrote a post a few weeks back on how to get an Avi proof of concept up and running. Hopefully, it helped and continues to help others wanting to start playing with Avi.
I like to spin my lab up and down, pushing config when needed. This post will be focused around the Avi APIs and how to stand up the basic configuration previously discussed.
I used the Avi API guide for reference: https://avinetworks.</description>

      <description>Load BalancingI covered Avi Networks at a high level in my first post. I now want to dive into the base configuration of Avi and at its core, it is a Load Balancer. Saying that there are a few flavours of Load Balancing.
Layer 4 Load Balancing. – Focusing on the IP address and TCP port. Layer 7 Load Balancing. – Focusing on layer 7 attributes such as HTTP headers. Global Server Load Balancing.</description>

      <description>What is Avi?Avi Networks provides software-defined Load Balancing at its core. Complementing the core service is a plethora of mouthwatering services and features. Surely the reason Avi was acquired by VMware on July 11th 2019. Rebranded as the NSX Advanced Load Balancer.
Some of the features include application analytics, predictive autoscaling, micro-segmentation and WAF (Web Application Firewall) all this and on both cloud and on-prem. The Load Balancer for any platform!</description>
